      Imagine you need or want to create a simple, but dynamic web application
      and it doesn't automatically mean installing 201 Node.js dependencies or
      accepting a subscription with a $25 monthly fee.</p><p>

      HTMX made an immense and fairly underrated contribution to solving this
      problem. But there's still an open question regarding a suitable back-end
      solution.</p><p>

      Usually you'll get the recommendation to use Django, Flask, or write the
      back-end in Go. But I would like to write my application logic in Lua.
      It's a great, simple, and readable prototyping language. There might be
      better solutions for production, but not many for a quick working draft
      that can be understood by other team members.</p><p>

      HPLN was the first attempt at HTMX on the front-end and Lua
      on the back-end. Generating HTML by having nginx execute Lua scripts felt
      natural at first. A look at the default.nix of this project will reveal
      quite some duct taping that was necessary to make it work.</p><p>

      So Lahna is just the next step in simplification. It's a web server
      written in Lua with just a couple of dependencies by default.</p>
