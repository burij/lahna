    > Building APIs, template systems, and design components with Lahna is very
    easy and a lot of fun. For most use cases, you probably only need to modify
    ./modules/router.lua

    > Define endpoints in M.get, M.post, or M.delete (depending on the desired

    > ./modules/utils.lua contains some helpful functions for string
    manipulation you might need in web development, like parsing Markdown to
    HTML. You can see it in action by
    <a href="#" hx-get="/mdtest" hx-target="#demo"> rendering README.md</a> of
